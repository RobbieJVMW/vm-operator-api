# Contributing to vm-operator-api

It's still early days for vm-operator-api, but we would love to connect with people who are as passionate about Kubernetes and Virtual Machines as we are!

Please raise issues and feel free to open PRs.

Any suggestions on usability, readability, clarity or architecture are all welcome.

Given that vm-operator-api is currently the API surface to a larger project, please be aware that we must consider the wider impact of any API changes.
